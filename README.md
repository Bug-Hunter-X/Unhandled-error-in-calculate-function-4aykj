# Unhandled Exception in Javascript

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: unhandled exceptions. The `calculate` function does not properly handle the `Error` thrown by the `divide` function when attempting to divide by zero.  This can lead to the application crashing unexpectedly.  The solution shows how to use a `try...catch` block to gracefully handle the error.
